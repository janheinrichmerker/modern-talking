We contribute to the ArgMining~2021 shared task on Quantitative Summarization and Key Point Analysis with two approaches for argument key point matching. 
For key point matching the task is to decide if a short key point matches the content of an argument with the same topic and stance towards the topic. 
We approach this task in two ways: 
First, we develop a simple rule-based baseline matcher by computing token overlap after removing stop words, stemming, 
and adding synonyms/antonyms.
Second, we fine-tune pretrained \Bert and \Roberta language models as a regression classifier for only a single epoch. 
We manually examine errors of our proposed matcher models and find that long arguments are harder to classify. Our fine-tuned \RobertaBase model achieves a mean average precision score of~0.913, the best score for strict labels of all participating teams.
